# Bike-Sharing_Demand_Prediction

## Problem Statement

One of the biggest challenges faced in the bike-sharing system is the unavailability or shortage of bike. This issue has attracted numerous researchers to predict the demand of bike-sharing so that the company is able to redistribute the bikes efficiently and accurately. Correctly predicting the count of the bikes can be challenging especially when the data collected are often imbalance (Sathiskumer and Cho, 2020a). Moreover, despite the several efforts to train models to predict the demand, there is no consensus on which machine learning techniques that will provide the best performance due to the different features applied (Albuquerque et al., 2021). Meanwhile, no standardised features have proven to be the variables that will significantly improve the models (Albuquerque et al., 2021). Lastly, it is observed that feature engineering is heavily focused in Kaggle kernels, but not in published journal articles. As a result, this report will investigate three main areas such as the best performing machine learning techniques, the feature engineering methods and the features that will significantly enhance the prediction of the bike-sharing demand.

## Project Objectives

A.	To explore and critique multiple machine learning techniques to accurately predicting the demand of bike-sharing;

B.	To optimise, fine-tune and explore the feature engineering methods and hyperparameter for better performance of predictive model; and

C.	To explore the correlation between features and discover the most relevant features that bring better accuracy to the predictive model.
